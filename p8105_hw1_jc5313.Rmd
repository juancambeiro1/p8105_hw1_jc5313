# Problem 1

I have installed the `penguins` dataset in the console.

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

I have just loaded the `penguins` dataset and now I want to write a short description of this dataset.

```{r}
summary(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
```

The penguins dataset contains the following:

* Eight variables: 

  * "species": three different species 
  
  * "island": three different islands
  
  * "bill_length_mm": mean of 43.92
  
  * "bill_depth_mm": mean of 17.15
  
  * "flipper_length_mm": mean of 200.9
  
  * "body_mass_g": mean of 4202
  
  * "sex": 165 females, 168 males, 11 N/A
  
  * "year": mean of 2008
  
* Size of dataset

  * 344 rows
  
  * 8 columns

Now, I will make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x)
